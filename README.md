## Usage

Once the repo is all set up onto your system, you will need to open a command line in the repo. Once the cli is open, run npm start to run the program. You will use your arrow keys to navigate the system as you go. Once started, you will be prompted with two choices. Either select a pre made vehicle or hit create vehicle. Creating a new vehicle will prompt you with choosing a type of vehicle. You will be prompted with a series of questions regarding your vehicle of choice. Afterwards you can choose to do an action with your vehicle depending on the type.
